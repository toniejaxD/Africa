1 Purpose and Context of the Project:
The African Wildlife application was developed as part of a credit project in a computer science degree course. Its main purpose is to present information about animals living on the African continent, with an emphasis on education and facilitating the browsing of zoological data. The subject of African animals was chosen because of the diversity of the continent's fauna and the need to highlight the threats faced by these unique species.

2 Functionality of the Application:
The app offers users several key functionalities:

Viewing Animal Data: Users can view information on various African animal species. The app allows data to be filtered by kingdom (e.g. mammals, reptiles) and diet type (e.g. herbivores, carnivores).
Detail pages: Each animal has its own page with detailed information, including a description, photos and additional scientific data.
Basket function: The app includes a simple basket function where users can add animals of interest to a personal list.
Data Management: Administrators can add new records, such as animals, kingdoms or types, and delete existing data.

3 Technologies:
The application was built using the following technologies:

-Programming Language: PHP - used for dynamic page generation and application logic handling.
-Database: MySQL - storing and managing animal, user and session data.
-Front-End: HTML and CSS - creating and styling the user interface for clarity and ease of navigation.
-PHP Sessions: Used to manage user status, enabling logins and basket personalisation.

4 Why Africa?
The choice of Africa as the theme for the project was no accident. Africa is home to some of the most diverse and fascinating species on Earth, 
yet it is also a continent where many of these species are endangered. 
The project aims to educate users about Africa's natural wealth and highlight the need to protect these unique ecosystems.
